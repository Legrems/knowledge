Knowledge base
==============

This documentation is a collection of notes, tips, and tricks that I have found useful while working with Django, Python, and my related technologies.
It is intended to be a quick reference guide for myself and others who may find it helpful.
It could also include snippets of code, explanations of concepts, and links to external resources, related to development or not.
